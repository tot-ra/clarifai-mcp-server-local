(Verse 1)
Floating free in zero G,
A tabby astronaut, that's me.
Chasing comets, sleek and fast,
A cosmic nap, built to last.
My whiskers twitch at nebulae bright,
Paws batting stars in endless night.

(Chorus)
Meow-ter space, a purrfect void,
Laser pointers, asteroids.
Scratching post on the lunar lander,
Galaxy's greatest commander.
Milk bowl constellation gleams,
Living out my cosmic dreams.

(Verse 2)
Through wormholes deep, I bravely leap,
While mission control is fast asleep.
Alien mice, a thrilling chase,
Across the vastness of this place.
My tail flicks signals, Morse code bright,
Guiding spaceships through the light.

(Chorus)
Meow-ter space, a purrfect void,
Laser pointers, asteroids.
Scratching post on the lunar lander,
Galaxy's greatest commander.
Milk bowl constellation gleams,
Living out my cosmic dreams.
