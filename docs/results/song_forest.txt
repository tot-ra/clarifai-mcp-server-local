(Verse 1)
Sunlight dapples through the leaves,
A ginger cat among the trees.
Silent paws on mossy ground,
Not a single snapping sound.
Climbing high on ancient oak,
Beneath a leafy, verdant cloak.

(Chorus)
Forest feline, wild and free,
Hunting voles with stealthy glee.
Whiskers brush the ferns so green,
The quietest hunter ever seen.
A babbling brook, a cool retreat,
Nature's rhythm, soft and sweet.

(Verse 2)
Chasing butterflies in flight,
Blinking in the dappled light.
Napping curled in hollow logs,
Ignoring croaking forest frogs.
The scent of pine, the earthy smell,
Underneath the forest's spell.

(Chorus)
Forest feline, wild and free,
Hunting voles with stealthy glee.
Whiskers brush the ferns so green,
The quietest hunter ever seen.
A babbling brook, a cool retreat,
Nature's rhythm, soft and sweet.
