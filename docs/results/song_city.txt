(Verse 1)
Concrete jungle, neon bright,
A sleek black cat slips through the night.
Alleyways my hidden routes,
Ignoring honking cars and shouts.
From fire escapes, I watch below,
The city's rhythm, ebb and flow.

(Chorus)
City kitty, sharp and sly,
Watching taxis hurry by.
Pigeons scatter, quick retreat,
Master of this urban street.
Streetlights cast long shadows deep,
Secrets that the sidewalks keep.

(Verse 2)
Dumpster diving, gourmet finds,
Leaving paw prints of all kinds.
A friendly nod to bodega cats,
Avoiding dogs and pesky rats.
On window sills, I take my ease,
Catching the cool night-time breeze.

(Chorus)
City kitty, sharp and sly,
Watching taxis hurry by.
Pigeons scatter, quick retreat,
Master of this urban street.
Streetlights cast long shadows deep,
Secrets that the sidewalks keep.
